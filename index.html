                                <p>My name is Brandon Anderson.
                                    I was born in 1999 on the 7th of June, in a small town called Echuca.
                                    I live with my mother Kylie, my sister Bianca, and my partner Kathy.
                                    I guess you could say my hobbies involve gaming as that makes up 60% of my life, the rest I am either drawing or focusing on getting my studying done.
                                    As a gamer, my main IT interests are learning how all the components in my gaming pc work.
                                    As of recently I have had a huge interest in the coding behind making a website.
                                    Before starting the bachelor of Information Technology, i had little to no IT experiences.
                                    Although i have now some experience in coding after making my own website using GitHub.
                                    I have joined together with a group of some amazing guys, and we're making good progress together.</p>

                                <p>Hello, I'm Jamie. I live in Tasmania and used to be a recovery mechanic (heavy vehicle tow truck driver) in the Aust army, but now drive trucks for Toll.
                                    I like to play rugby and video games.
                                    I also like to build computers.
                                    I have always wanted to study I.T. but I left school before I could get an ATAR score.
                                    So, I waited until I was a mature age student to apply. I know how components go together, but I would like to see how they interact with each other.
                                    I also have a pretty keen interest in web design and development.
                                    The only I.T. experience I have is building computers, making a basic website due to this course and some basics skills in high school.
                                    I'm glad I found a good group in this course they have taught me a great deal in a short amount of time and wouldn't be here without them.

                                    I have a strong background in blockchain technology, having worked at Exodus, the most popular cryptocurrency wallet in the world,
                                     and Ambrosus, a smart platform for supply chain tracking. I currently volunteer at a startup called Stage8, a decentralised exchange
                                     using military-grade secure knox containers.
                                    After teaching myself to code and working for some amazing companies, I loved it so much I decided to study software development at university.
                                    Before I wrote code, I worked in publishing writing and editing books. I also like vaping and anime desu. UwU.</p>

                                <p> I'm Ryan, I was born and raised in Wollongong, Australia.
                                    Before studying IT, I studied physics and Japanese, and I play the guitar in my free time.
                                    My interest in IT started when I was only four years old.
                                    I remember making artwork in MS Paint and playing Minesweeper.
                                    Growing up, I would spend a lot of time on a Windows 2000 PC, mainly talking to friends and playing games.
                                    Eventually I wanted a more powerful gaming PC, so I got all the parts I would need and assembled the computer with my Dad’s help.
                                    I gained a basic knowledge of the components in a PC and their functions, and I was able to swap out parts and perform maintenance by myself.
                                    I've since gained experience with JavaScript and Object-Oriented programming in Java. </p>

                    <p>
                        We have an extremely balanced team. The first letter in the Meyers Brigg's Personality test is extroversion (E) or introversion (I), which
                        measures general attitude [1].
                        Both James and Jamie show a preference for extroversion, and Brandon and Ryan show a preference for introversion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second letter stands for intuition (N) or sensing (S), which measures perception.
                        Once again, we have two intuitive types, James and Jamie; and two
                        sensing types, Brandon and Ryan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third letter is thinking (T) or feeling (F), which measures judgement, with the entire team favouring feeling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fourth letter is judging (J) or perceiving (P), which measures whether someone is more perceptive or more judgemental,
                         with most of the team favouring perception.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>We have a variety of learning styles; however, visual learners seem more common. Our team seems to be naturally balanced, and it shows in our team work.</p>
                    <p>Communication has been frequent and effortless.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        Both team members who took the Big 5 test scored highly on positive factors compared to the max of 120 per metric. A lower neurotic score, however, does mean
                        higher neuroticism. Fortunately, the differences between James and Ryan's neuroticism scores should balance out nicely.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we have two creative types who favour complexity. I cannot think of a better metric for two people who want to make waves in the IT industry.

                    <p>The vast majority of our team wants to become developers, with Brandon wanting to become a jack-of-all trades and work as a consultant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The difference between what each developer finds to be an ideal job may lie in short VS long term thinking. A full stack developer is a developer with
                        such a wealth of knowledge they can build an application's front and backend from scratch, and then deploy it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Striving to be a full stack developer is a longer term goal because of the knowledge required; whereas, a junior developer has graduate-level knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of the would-be developers on our team are primarily focussed on web development.
                    </p>
                    <p>Brandon's ideal job as a consultant is motivated by helping people. A consultant, after all, solves IT problems. His background in design
                        will be an invaluable asset to future clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>Overall, our team's collective knowledge on web development and design will serve us well on any project. Likewise, th balance of our personality types
                        is highly conducive to teamwork.

                              <p>Sam is a Web designer at zest. He is the only designer and marketer in the building and works on all the client’s websites.
                              Sam’s day to day work consists of rocking up to the office and greeting whoever is in the open workspace.
                              He then proceeds to make his first coffee for the day, then Sam makes his way to his desk where he checks his emails to see if anything new has come through overnight.
                              He then opens zest’s workflow files to see his current and future projects. From there Sam’s day can vary from meeting with clients to sitting down and designing all day,
                              Sam could also push some work to Owen Richards to develop a finished design. Sam also makes multiply coffees over the span of the day he says.</p>

                              <p>Sam says, “he works in the I.T. and marketing industry and it is an everchanging environment, it’s not a boring working place as one task is never the same”.
                              Apart from designing the websites he makes. He also has to work with accountant’s web developers and client’s needs.
                              Apart from the clients Sam works with, his main partner in crime is a Web Developer by the name of Owen Richards.
                              Owen runs a business called O-WEB and he is an off-site consultant for zest Launceston. Apart from Owen,
                              Sam does not really interact with anyone from the I.T. world because Zest is a small business in Launceston, Tasmania.
                              He only works directly with his clients he has and his web dev Owen.</P>

                              <p>Sam has most of the interaction with the clients as he is the first point of call for a website.
                              Sam meets with the client to see what sort of website that they would like him to build.
                              Sam spends most of his time coming up with the design of the client’s website.
                              Sam also spends a lot of his time laying his design out and picking the most suitable style for the website.
                              Sam’s most challenging thing is when a client sees the finished product then sees something that they might not like and wants his to change the website to please the client’s needs.
                              He says, “you really need to get it right the first time”.</P>
