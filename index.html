                                <p>My name is Brandon Anderson.
                                    I was born in 1999 on the 7th of June, in a small town called Echuca.
                                    I live with my mother Kylie, my sister Bianca, and my partner Kathy.
                                    I guess you could say my hobbies involve gaming as that makes up 60% of my life, the
                                    rest I am either drawing or focusing on getting my studying done.
                                    As a gamer, my main IT interests are learning how all the components in my gaming pc
                                    work.
                                    As of recently I have had a huge interest in the coding behind making a website.
                                    Before starting the bachelor of Information Technology, i had little to no IT
                                    experiences.
                                    Although i have now some experience in coding after making my own website using
                                    GitHub.
                                    I have joined together with a group of some amazing guys, and we're making good
                                    progress together.</p>

                                <p>Hello, I'm Jamie. I live in Tasmania and used to be a recovery mechanic (heavy
                                    vehicle tow truck driver) in the Aust army, but now drive trucks for Toll.
                                    I like to play rugby and video games.
                                    I also like to build computers.
                                    I have always wanted to study I.T. but I left school before I could get an ATAR
                                    score.
                                    So, I waited until I was a mature age student to apply. I know how components go
                                    together, but I would like to see how they interact with each other.
                                    I also have a pretty keen interest in web design and development.
                                    The only I.T. experience I have is building computers, making a basic website due to
                                    this course and some basics skills in high school.
                                    I'm glad I found a good group in this course they have taught me a great deal in a
                                    short amount of time and wouldn't be here without them.

                                <p>I'm James, a junior JavaScript full stack engineer specializing in UI.
                                    My favorite front end framework is React, and I love writing servers in Node with a
                                    NoSQL database.
                                    I have a strong background in blockchain technology, having worked at Exodus, the
                                    most popular cryptocurrency wallet in the world,
                                    and Ambrosus, a smart platform for supply chain tracking. I currently volunteer at a
                                    startup called Stage8, a decentralised exchange
                                    using military-grade secure knox containers.
                                    After teaching myself to code and working for some amazing companies, I loved it so
                                    much I decided to study software development at university.
                                    Before I wrote code, I worked in publishing writing and editing books. I also like
                                    vaping and anime desu. UwU.</p>

                                <p> I'm Ryan, I was born and raised in Wollongong, Australia.
                                    Before studying IT, I studied physics and Japanese, and I play the guitar in my free
                                    time.
                                    My interest in IT started when I was only four years old.
                                    I remember making artwork in MS Paint and playing Minesweeper.
                                    Growing up, I would spend a lot of time on a Windows 2000 PC, mainly talking to
                                    friends and playing games.
                                    Eventually I wanted a more powerful gaming PC, so I got all the parts I would need
                                    and assembled the computer with my Dad’s help.
                                    I gained a basic knowledge of the components in a PC and their functions, and I was
                                    able to swap out parts and perform maintenance by myself.
                                    I've since gained experience with JavaScript and Object-Oriented programming in
                                    Java. </p>

                        We have an extremely balanced team. The first letter in the Meyers Brigg's Personality test is
                        extroversion (E) or introversion (I), which
                        measures general attitude [1].
                        Both James and Jamie show a preference for extroversion, and Brandon and Ryan show a preference
                        for introversion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second letter stands for intuition (N) or sensing (S), which measures perception.
                        Once again, we have two intuitive types, James and Jamie; and two
                        sensing types, Brandon and Ryan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third letter is thinking (T) or feeling (F), which measures judgement, with the entire team
                        favouring feeling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fourth letter is judging (J) or perceiving (P), which measures whether someone is more
                        perceptive or more judgemental,
                        with most of the team favouring perception.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>We have a variety of learning styles; however, visual learners seem more common. Our team seems
                        to be naturally balanced, and it shows in our team work.</p>
                    <p>Communication has been frequent and effortless.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        Both team members who took the Big 5 test scored highly on positive factors compared to the max
                        of 120 per metric. A lower neurotic score, however, does mean
                        higher neuroticism. Fortunately, the differences between James and Ryan's neuroticism scores
                        should balance out nicely.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we have two creative types who favour complexity. I cannot think of a better metric for
                        two people who want to make waves in the IT industry.
                    </p>

                    <p>The vast majority of our team wants to become developers, with Brandon wanting to become a
                        jack-of-all trades and work as a consultant.

                    <p>
                        The difference between what each developer finds to be an ideal job may lie in short VS long
                        term thinking. A full stack developer is a developer with
                        such a wealth of knowledge they can build an application's front and backend from scratch, and
                        then deploy it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Striving to be a full stack developer is a longer term goal because of the knowledge required;
                        whereas, a junior developer has graduate-level knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of the would-be developers on our team are primarily focussed on web development.
                    </p>
                    <p>Brandon's ideal job as a consultant is motivated by helping people. A consultant, after all,
                        solves IT problems. His background in design
                        will be an invaluable asset to future clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>Overall, our team's collective knowledge on web development and design will serve us well on any
                        project. Likewise, th balance of our personality types
                        is highly conducive to teamwork.

                        developers; likewise, the jack-of-all trades consultant's skillset isn't limited to working in
                        software alone, so demand is high for good reason.</p>

                    <p>This trend is mirrored in the data provided by Burning Glass Technologies in that
                        <i>developer</i> ranks lower than <i>fullstack developer</i>, which ranks lower than <i>senior
                            developer</i>, and at
                        the very top of their chart is a job title <i>solutions architect</i> (Top IT Job Titles March,
                        2018), which is a fancy term for a consultant.

                    <p>The overall trend based on data from Burning Glass Technologies (Top IT Skills March, 2018, 2018)
                        is that the skillset of a junior developer isn't
                        as in demand as that of a fullstack developer or a consultant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interestingly, an IT Consultant and full stack developer's skills overlap very closely; however,
                        a consultant requires additional generalized IT skills like technical support that a developer
                        wouldn't necessarily need to provide.
                    </p>
                    <p>Java, SPA, and Business Management are the three highest IT skills not in our required skills.
                        Note: We want to be web developers, and Java isn't commonly used compared to other languages.
                        An IT Consultant may have use for Java, however.
                        Likewise, a Single Page Application isn't specific to web development, so I chose not to include
                        it.

                    <p>The overall trend based on data from Burning Glass Technologies (Top Generic Skills March, 2018,
                        2018) is that all three jobs lean heavily on the most in demand skills like troubleshooting,
                        communication, and team work.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the writing skill, I chose to rename it report writing because <i>writing</i> is too
                        vague to draw a meaningful conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Yes, developers need to write documentation, but generalised writing skills in the sense of
                        communication isn't as necessary for a developer as it would be a journalist.</p>
                    <p>The ability for a consultant to write a report is likely extremely valuable.</p>
                    <p>The same trends here for the general skills as those in the IT skills can also be seen with the
                        overlap between the fullstack developer and the consultant.</p>
                    <p>However, on this chart, the junior developer needs much more general skills than they do IT
                        skills.</p>
                    <p>The three highest ranked general skills not in our required skills are problem solving,
                        organisation, and planning.
                        In making the decision not to include these skills, I decided that organisation is more
                        important for leadership roles than individual developers/consultants working under a project
                        lead.
                        I also didn't include problem solving because it seemed redundant as troubleshooting is already
                        a required skill. Likewise, planning is another aspect that would better suit a leadership role.
                        Although an IT Consultant could fill the role of leadership, it would be more likely for a
                        consultant to work under a CTO to solve a very specific problem or under a technical lead.

                    <p>Exploring these trends only supported our original opinions about our ideal jobs.</p>
                    <p>The demand for a junior developer is paramount to the amount of time it takes to become a junior
                        developer.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, there is a higher time investment in becoming a consultant or a fullstack developer,
                        and the demand reflects this.</p>
                    <p>Our opinions remain unchanged regarding our ideal jobs, but we now have the data to backup said
                        opinions.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Sam is a Web designer at zest. He is the only designer and marketer in the building and works on
                        all the client’s websites.
                        Sam’s day to day work consists of rocking up to the office and greeting whoever is in the open
                        workspace.
                        He then proceeds to make his first coffee for the day, then Sam makes his way to his desk where
                        he checks his emails to see if anything new has come through overnight.
                        He then opens zest’s workflow files to see his current and future projects. From there Sam’s day
                        can vary from meeting with clients to sitting down and designing all day,
                        Sam could also push some work to Owen Richards to develop a finished design. Sam also makes
                        multiply coffees over the span of the day he says.</p>

                    <p>Sam says, “he works in the I.T. and marketing industry and it is an everchanging environment,
                        it’s not a boring working place as one task is never the same”.
                        Apart from designing the websites he makes. He also has to work with accountant’s web developers
                        and client’s needs.
                        Apart from the clients Sam works with, his main partner in crime is a Web Developer by the name
                        of Owen Richards.
                        Owen runs a business called O-WEB and he is an off-site consultant for zest Launceston. Apart
                        from Owen,
                        Sam does not really interact with anyone from the I.T. world because Zest is a small business in
                        Launceston, Tasmania.
                        He only works directly with his clients he has and his web dev Owen.</P>

                    <p>Sam has most of the interaction with the clients as he is the first point of call for a website.
                        Sam meets with the client to see what sort of website that they would like him to build.
                        Sam spends most of his time coming up with the design of the client’s website.
                        Sam also spends a lot of his time laying his design out and picking the most suitable style for
                        the website.
                        Sam’s most challenging thing is when a client sees the finished product then sees something that
                        they might not like and wants his to change the website to please the client’s needs.
                        He says, “you really need to get it right the first time”.</P>

                    <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
                    <p>Cyber security is the act of protecting computer systems, programs and networks big and small
                        from digital attracts.
                        Cyberattacks point their eyes at gaining access to your systems, maybe changings your files or
                        even destroy systems or information.
                        The basics of cyber security can stem from choosing a strong password, to even watching for
                        attachments from emails.
                        At the end of the day cybersecurity is everyone business, we must ensure that we all be aware of
                        what information we may decide to
                        post of social media to what we put in the casual work emails sent around the office. (CISCO
                        2019).</p>

                    <p>A good place to state would be looking at the current state of cybersecurity.
                        As of 2019 a study from ISACA shows that “69% of cyber pros say their teams are understaffed”
                        and “34% of security pros have a high
                        degree of confidence in their team’s ability to detect and respond to cyber threats” (ISACA,
                        2019).</p>

                    <p>In Australia most of our digital presence comes from the private sector. With this the Australian
                        government is working on making
                        such an effort in ensuring that Australia’s cyber risks are mitigated. This means that the
                        government is making sure that they work
                        hard in trying to make the workplace a safe and risk-free place as possible. The Australian
                        government has a strategy in place until 2020,
                        working on 5 mains parts of cyber security this includes;
                        <li>Growth and innovation,</li>
                        <li>Stronger cyber defences,</li>
                        <li>A cyber smart nation,</li>
                        <li>National cyber partnership,</li>
                        <li>Global responsibly.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>There has been a positive that have come from cyber risks within Australia. The Box Hill
                        institute with industry support have made two
                        qualifications regarding cyber security and they are an advanced Diploma of cyber security and
                        Certificate IV in cyber security. With the
                        creation of these two professional skills, we will secure more jobs for our nation and hopefully
                        provide more cyber security so Australians
                        and the world can have a safer time on their technology. (Australian Government 2019).</p>

                    <p>It seems to be pretty hard to predict what cyber security will look like in 5-10 years times.
                        With the advancements in technology and the
                        everchanging tactics from hackers. A good example would be if we think of X and Y as a risk to
                        our digital presence and we build a wall to
                        protect for those risks then there would be someone out there that would just build Z to aim at
                        us. With the advances in technology those
                        hackers will also need to learn how they work and also how to take it down, so if the world of
                        technology can just keep in front then we might
                        be able to live in a risk-free world. So, as the nation sponsored organisations develop
                        cyber-attack technology, the financially supported cyber
                        criminals continue to develop way to monetize attacks. They will also find ways to find ways to
                        show that they cannot be targeted who the crimes
                        they have committed.</p>

                    <p>Some personal things to ensure your security at home can include;
                        <li>Use software on your devices like Trend Micro and Kaspersky to keep your devices safe,</li>
                        <li>Back up your important files,</li>
                        <li>Password protect devices in case you lose your devices, or they are stolen,</li>
                        <li>Use legitimate software not pirated ones to ensure there is malware within it,</li>
                        <li>Be aware of scam emails and phone calls,</li>
                        <li>Ensure you have a screen lock on devices to fend off people getting access to information,
                        </li>
                        <li>Try to avoid free wireless networks in cafes and public places as they are a hacker’s
                            paradise. (Australian Cyber Security Centre 2019).</li>
                    </p>

                    <p>With most of everything we do now being online, most of our personal information can be accessed.
                        To be honest no matter how good of a job we
                        do trying to protect it, hackers and cyber criminals will eventually find a wat around this. For
                        small businesses this could mean going bankrupt,
                        according to Daniel Castro a cyber attack can cost sometimes between $57 and $109 billion. In
                        most cases small businesses think that they will be
                        ok because they might not be that popular or thought to have much money to lose, but it doesn’t
                        matter to most hackers. For a cybercriminal money is
                        money so if they only get $50 off your business, they might end up getting thousands off another
                        the very next day. (INNEFU 2019). </p>

                    <p>There has been a change in the cyber-attack industry, some might not call it a job but if you get
                        paid for work then it’s a job. There are a lot
                        of people doing this there for its an industry. But changes in attack vector have increased with
                        some things as SaaS and API’s. this allows hackers
                        more vantage points to target their victims. More and more companies are moving their stuff to
                        the cloud meaning in some cases an easier way of penetrating
                        security parameters. As it is attackers will look at taking the easiest access and low hanging
                        fruit. The attacking population is growing exponentially
                        with the increase of IoT devices we are creating. I think that the only reason this is happening
                        is because we want all devices to be connected to each other,
                        we only brought this upon ourselves. We should have thought about maybe developing security
                        measure before connecting everything and everyone. But in defence
                        we really did not have the time to prepare for this. (Tom Smith 2019).</p>

                    <p>Nowadays cyber security is a bit part of my everyday life. I found looking at a news website and
                        there are ads and popups, you try all day to avoid them,
                        but they are always there. Sometimes you bump them, and you scramble quickly to try and hit the
                        back button before something happens to your device. Another
                        thing I have noticed around me is children using devices, they have no information in them
                        telling them that what they are pressing on in possibly malicious
                        or other sort of threat. A report from Norton cyber security states a few facts that might help
                        us understand security in our household;
                        <li>40% of millennials report having experienced cybercrime in the past year,</li>
                        <li>7 in 10 people would like to make their home wireless network more secure,</li>
                        <li>3 in 10 people cannot detect that they are a victim of a phishing attack,</li>
                        <li>83% of people have said they have been a victim of a phishing attack.</li>
                    </p>

                    <p>There are a few things you might be able to help your family avoid being attacked, passwords
                        should contain a combination of 10 uppercase letters with some
                        symbol and numbers thrown in there. Try to look at the emails heading before you open them, if I
                        looks like you should have not received that email then maybe
                        it might be a phishing attack. Another good thing to do around your house is when you buy a new
                        network connected device, it would be a good idea to change the
                        default password just to ensure a little more security. This next solution might cost money, but
                        it is worth the protection that it provides to your household
                        and all devices connected to the network and that is anti-virus software like trend micro or
                        Kaspersky. (Norton 2019).</p>

                    <h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>

                    <p>In 2019 Cryptocurrencies are relatively new but let’s look at the backbone tech of the currency
                        and that is called blockchain. Blockchain was invented back in
                        1991 where Dr W. Scott Stornetta and his co-author Dr Stuart Harber published a whitepaper
                        bringing to life ‘Blockchain’ which is a decentralised, cryptic peer
                        to peer database where digital transactions are held and secured. Back in 2008 pseudonymous
                        Satoshi Nakamoto a white paper called Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital
                        currency or cryptocurrency that can in real-time transfer funds without intermediary such as a
                        financial institution overseeing the transaction. Outside of
                        finance many industries like governments or real estate could take advantage of blockchain to be
                        able to record ownership and transfer without using an intermediary
                        or risk of human error. That offers promise to companies that can get a handle of this
                        technology early on. (FinTech 2019).</p>

                    <p>Currently cryptocurrency can be used to buy all sorts of things from shops to dining out. But
                        there are a few that you might not know of and they are;
                        <li>Donate to causes, GiveCrypto.org is a non-profit that distributes it to people living in
                            poverty,</li>
                        <li>You can gift other people with the digital currencies,</li>
                        <li>You can tip people like musician, actors or content creators,</li>
                        <li>You can travel the world with it as cryptocurrencies are not tied to just one country so you
                            can save on conversion rates. (Coinbase 2019).</li>
                    </p>

                    <p>I believe that once the world really grasps blockchain and cryptocurrencies it could just be
                        considered normal. Like big banks should be taking a look at all
                        of this and start to develop ways to incorporate this into everyday banking. Blockchain is not
                        all about currency, it can also be a way of super-fast speed data
                        transfer. We already have ways of downloading large files in minutes, imagine buying a game from
                        an online store and being able to play it in seconds. That is
                        the way blockchain can take us into the future. In my travel across the world I have seen so
                        many countries adopt cryptocurrencies as payment from Bitcoin to Ethereum.
                        As I come from Tasmania, we have yet to see it, if any transaction at a local shop for
                        cryptocurrencies. I was amazed as a gentleman came into the local 7/11 in Phuket,
                        Thailand and purchased a cheese toasty and a bottle of coke with Bitcoin. (Cryptonite 2018).
                    </p>

                    <p>With cryptocurrencies people can now transfer funds across the other side of the world in seconds
                        rather than days with big banks. Soon we will adopt this method as our
                        default payment when paying for things. Like if my friend was overseas and something happen and
                        he lost his wallet or ran out of money, I can then transfer some currency
                        and he can have it in seconds. To me that is a life saver and game changer. As technology
                        evolves and we start shaping the future around being a fully connected world then
                        cryptocurrency is a must. One last point for where cryptocurrencies will be going in the future
                        is financial institutions. These institutions will eventually have to follow
                        suit to allow these currencies into there mix. Institutions will make some sort of package for
                        the crypto side of things. And work in unison with one another eventually.
                        (Crytponite 2018).</p>

                    <p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might sound and look shiny but there is a bad side to it all.
                        There are 3 areas in which this can have a negative impact and they are
                        the economy, environment and criminality. Cryptocurrencies can have a negative effect on the
                        averment with people across the world running ‘mining farms’ these are giant
                        server looking computers drawing a lot of power just to make sure that all the transaction
                        around the world can be made, as stated above cryptocurrencies are made possible
                        by using peer to peer. But then you could argue that financial institutions are wasting a lot of
                        power running multiply physical banks all across the world. So, either way
                        both financial institutions and crypto farming can generate massive amounts of pollution. </p>

                    <p>With the rise cryptocurrencies criminality has also risen. The anonymity that this service
                        provides is a key place for people to pay for such services as hitman or maybe
                        to money launder. Making is of all without ever being able to be traced has seen a rise in
                        crime. It is also a good place for hacker to get their dirty work done. As we all
                        should know a lot of companies all around the world have had their information stolen, just to
                        be held at ransom from hackers and to pay them in bitcoin for the release
                        of their information.</p>

                    <p>Another place this can be used is in the economy. Because cryptocurrencies can be really hard to
                        trace and even impossible, people like to go to the deep net or dark web.
                        This part of the internet is hidden from most search engines and makes up 98% of the internet.
                        But is a good place for people to buy and sell drugs, weapons or even human
                        trafficking. (Leo Garnier 2017).</p>

                    <p>As I do not use cryptocurrencies where I live it does not affect me currently. But in the near
                        future I would imagine that I will be forced to start using the service as
                        this will be a vital part of the economy. As well as my family would have to start using it
                        also. As Tasmania grows, which it does daily. I would most likely be finding
                        myself at a store or shop looking at the Bitcoin payment system and wondering, maybe I should be
                        investing in this thing. I do have a couple of friends who keep watch of
                        bitcoin, just to do the investment strategy. They rare now glued to their phones, checking on
                        how bitcoin is doing every 2 hours just waiting for that number to drop. My
                        friend says that he really enjoys bitcoin. He has also said to me that it is more of a game to
                        him. Personally, I would consider Bitcoin watching more like gambling than
                        a game. It’s not like you are wasting fake money on it. You could potentially lose all your life
                        saving playing the investment game. I think that we all need to be careful
                        when dealing in cryptocurrencies as we could be buying it at a high point without doing
                        research. Then it could drop dramatically resulting in you losing your money.
                        I believe at this point in the tech it would be better just saving your money in a financial
                        institution. </p>

                    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                    <p>Let's start with defining what is meant by machine learning because the layperson can incorrectly
                        use AI and machine learning as synonyms. Arthur Samuel, famous for creating the first
                        self-learning program that allowed players to play checkers against a computer, coined the term
                        “machine learning” in 1951 (En.wikipedia.org, 2019). Machine learning is what allowed Arthur's
                        computer opponent to make decisions based on the moves of a human player—the computer opponent
                        actually improved over time; in other words, machine learning is a big part of AI, but not AI
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>“Machine learning is, at its core, the process of granting a machine or model access to data and
                        letting it learn for itself (Valchanov, 2019).” This is perhaps too vague a statement to shed a
                        great deal of light, so let's go back 15 years earlier before Arthur's conceptualisation of a
                        self-learning machine. In 1936, Alan Turing, famous for breaking the Enigma Code and
                        philosophising the Turing Test (En.wikipedia.org, 2019), published a paper called On
                        Computational Numbers. This paper spoke of a Universal Machine that could make computations. And
                        this was one of the first modern moments of data mining.</p>
                    <p>Data mining gave birth to machine learning, but data alone is useless without interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Imagine we have a data set containing 2 million social media accounts who use a profile picture
                        that predominantly makes use of the colour blue. A data scientist could look at this mass of
                        mined data and make predictions based on users who prefer to feature this blue in their profile
                        pictures—let's say people with blue profile pictures on average complain of sleep problems more
                        than the general population—but wouldn't it be nice if both the mining of this data and its
                        interpretation could all be automated. </p>
                    <p>That way, we could draw conclusions on the sleep health of anyone based on colour preference
                        without having to write multiple versions of the same program for each colour, and most
                        importantly, without having to collect another 2 million social media accounts per colour.</p>
                    <p>Better still, wouldn't it be amazing if the conclusions this program draws happen to change
                        overtime according to the data inputted? Say, just like a computer getting better at checkers
                        the more opponents it plays against. It's infinitely more efficient to feed data into a machine
                        over time than requiring a massive data set before meaningful results can be obtained, and this
                        is a massive advantage of a self-learning algorithm.</p>
                    <p>In 2019, we can do a great deal more than mine data and lose at checkers. One of the most
                        impressive implementations of machine learning is NVIDIA's artificial faces program (The Verge,
                        2019), and the faces this algorithm generates are indistinguishable from real people. It uses
                        something called a generative adversarial network; basically, a machine learns to generate data
                        that's similar to the data given to it (En.wikipedia.org, 2019) , and in this case, the data
                        given was photographs. </p>
                    <p>This one application of machine learning is going to lay the foundation for procedural generated
                        virtual environments that are as life like as real life. Imagine putting on a VR headset and
                        interacting with characters who were generated from generative adversarial networks. Likewise,
                        the background itself was the result of a machine looking at landscapes and spitting out
                        landscapes. Furthermore, if a machine can learn to generate images, it can surely learn to
                        generate entire personalities and language patterns, creating artificial people with all the
                        depth and complexity as human beings.</p>
                    <p>The future of search engines will be profoundly accurate (Pickell, 2019) . Google is already
                        using deep learning, a method of machine-learning that mimics the human brain (En.wikipedia.org,
                        2019), to provide highly personalised search results, but it's going to reach the point where
                        it's so accurate, typing a handful of characters will come up with highly relevant suggestions,
                        and these suggestions will be based on IoT connected devices like smart phones providing Google
                        a wealth of personal data that they can use to further personalise search experiences.</p>
                    <p> The future of software development could potentially be more about managing AI algorithms than
                        teams of developers (Pickell, 2019). The idea of using an application to generate code instead
                        of writing it by hand is not new (Mendix, 2019), and this idea is referred to as “low code”.
                        What is ground breaking is the idea of a a machine learning to write code and producing an
                        application, and this is referred to as “no code.” The irony of developers creating
                        self-learning libraries that can be used to make themselves obsolete is fantastic.</p>
                    <p>This idea, of course, isn't particularly substantiated. Machines are very good at doing
                        repetitive tasks; however, we have one thing machines don't yet possess, and that's emotion. For
                        this reason, a machine is unlikely to be able to produce artistic works with the same depth as
                        human beings (The Drum, 2019); after all, art is an emotive medium.</p>
                    <p>The media has a tendency to propagate fear. And in support of my previous point, 60 Minutes
                        latched on to an AI expert claiming that AI would replace 40% of jobs (Inc.com, 2019). “It
                        [leadership] requires a uniquely human quality that AI doesn't have: imagination. Without
                        imagination, you can't put yourself in another person's shoes and sympathize with their point of
                        view.“ The interview focused only on Lee's disconcerting statements and not on the empowering
                        aspects of his work: that the age of AI will free humans to work creatively without the burden
                        of processing.</p>
                    <p>“AI will become one of the top five investment priorities for at least 30 percent of Chief
                        Information Officers (DATAVERSITY, 2019) .” This trend in information technology will change the
                        way information is processed. I anticipate a world where servers that users make requests to are
                        nothing more than deep learning algorithms that generate computer code and return it to the user
                        in the form of a website. </p>
                    <p>What's currently known as an Application Programming Interface (API) may be later known as an
                        Application Neural Interface (ANI). Likewise, user interfaces could potentially become adaptive
                        in the sense that a user's artistic preferences may go on to shape the kind of UI they interact
                        with. If Spotify can use machine learning to suggest songs a user may enjoy based on their
                        existing song choices (Medium, 2019), an application could just as easily spawn an interface
                        based on previous interactions with themes.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, I feel machine learning and its application as a sub field of AI will make a lot of
                        data entry and processing jobs redundant, but it won't be as devastating as presented by the
                        media. For example, Facebook has a team of content moderators that keep the platform clean of
                        inappropriate content. You would think you could train an AI to identify inappropriate content
                        and remove it, but it's not that simple (The Verge, 2019). Yes, an AI can identify a gun or
                        nudity, but it's the context, which comes from contemporary culture, that dictate whether an old
                        man's Winchester mounted over the mantle or a woman breastfeeding is different than a teenager
                        showing off an unlicensed firearm or blatant pornography.</p>
                    <p>In my daily life, I'm not certain I'll live to see the full fruition of this technology, but what
                        it can already do is already improving my life through convenience. For example, Uber Eats uses
                        AI to predict meal arrival times (Medium, 2019), and from personal experiences, it's very
                        accurate. This is a simple example of how AI is already affecting me. It's not as exciting as
                        creating an entire artificial landscape, but it is extremely practical.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, AI and machine-learning has made navigation a much easier experience (Agarwal,
                        2019). As someone who experiences driving related anxiety, having a navigation app that can
                        correlate weather patterns, traffic data, accident reports, and use all of these data points to
                        suggest an optimum route is an application of AI most aren't aware is happening.</p>
                    <p>Finally, machine-learning is already extremely established in marketing to predict advertisements
                        that will be relevant to the target audience (Kaput, 2019) , which is very nice. Ads are really
                        only annoying when they're regarding products you don't care about, right. When I see an ad for
                        a course on LinkedIn learning pop up on my feed based on courses I've already taken, and it's
                        consequentially an interesting and useful subject to me, I genuinely don't mind, and I've used
                        this AI -powered marketing in lieu of having to search for something myself, so having relevant
                        information just handed to me is also a huge benefit.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p><b><i>Clouds and Services:</i></b></p>

                        <p>Clouds and Services go hand in hand, A Cloud is a Service that is accessible by the user on
                          demand from the providers Servers.</p>

                          <p>A Service is a system that provides the consumer with the resources that the user needs.</p>

                          <p>There are three types of Cloud Computing, Software as a Service (SaaS),
                            Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).</p>

                            <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is a service model, in which the user pays for a software application,
                              through the means of a subscription basis and then installed from the providers cloud datacenter.
                              A Software as a Service is a month to monthly payment that the user pays to get access to the
                              hardware or license. After the user has done the payment, the provider then delivers the software
                              to your device over the internet. The software is streamed from the providers Servers,
                              which means that the providers are responsible for maintaining the Servers and updating the software
                              for the consumers. (Dummies, 2019).</p>

                              <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model, in which a provider, delivers software
                                and hardware tools, for the user via the internet. A Platform as a Service (PaaS) allows the
                                consumer to operate applications without having to first install the hardware and or software required.
                                A Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, builds and supplies the consumer with a strong and advanced
                                environment, that the user can then use to install applications and data sets.
                                This allows the consumers to focus on creating and running the applications, rather than constructing
                                and maintaining the framework and services themselves. Due to the feature of a PaaS,
                                a business will usually rely on PaaS providers for their key services. For example, java development
                                and application hosting. (Dummies, 2019).</p>

                                <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the process of moving the core infrastructure equipment to the
                                  Cloud. This allows companies and businesses to no longer need to worry about buying and maintaining
                                  said equipment. These equipment’s can be anything from Telephone systems, to Servers and Firewalls.
                                  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) allows the consumers to purchase the services like a utility
                                  for the equipment that is required. IaaS allows businesses to save money, because It saves the
                                  consumer from having to hire a specialist to come around to the location of their company and go
                                  around the infrastructure repairing or improving the equipment, this saves money because the consumer
                                  will not have to hire the person, because all the equipment will be in one place in the Cloud.
                                  However due to this, the rolls of technicians are at risk. (Dummies, 2019).</p>

                                  <p><b><i>Servers:</i></b></p>

                                  <p>A Server is a computer program that provides the functionality for other computer
                                  programs called Clients. (Wikipedia, 2019).
                                  <br />
                                  A Server is a network computer that contains all the required resources needed,
                                  from hard drives to printers and shares information and other resources to another network computer,
                                  where as a Client does not have share its resources with other Clients or Servers.
                                  Any computer that is not a Server are referred to as a Client. A Server is usually the most expensive
                                  and powerful computers in a network, where the less powerful and cheaper computers in a
                                  network are the Clients. The Clients are the computers that individual users use for everyday work.
                                  Due to the functionality of a Client, a network will always have more Clients then Servers,
                                  for example, a network with ten Clients, could probably get by with just the one Server.
                                  <br />
                                  The benefits of having a Server are, your files and network have a better security backing them up,
                                  in which increases the reliability of the Server. Servers grant better protection to viruses,
                                  having all the data on one server also allows for easier and more regular data backups.
                                  <br />
                                  Personally, I believe, that in 3 years from now, all business big and small will have migrated
                                  from using clients to using servers, and I believe that the security of these servers
                                  will also increase. (Dummies, 2019).</p>

                                  <p><b><i>What is the likely impact?</i></b></p>

                                  <p>Due to Cloud Computing and the Clouds functions and ability’s, to make the life of those who
                                    require technology within a workplace a whole lot easier, it shows that the Cloud is here to stay,
                                    and it is impacting technician’s jobs.
                                    <br />
                                    Within the next 5 – 10 years, it is expected that Cloud Computing will heavily impact IT jobs.
                                    <br />
                                    Although this could be bad for some technicians, it could also be a good thing for others.
                                    This is because there will be less need for technicians to do business and house calls,
                                    however there will be a greater need for technicians to run, operate and maintain these new Cloud services.

                                    This change of jobs will also open new jobs that will be needed to support the Cloud. These jobs can be
                                    anything from Marketing Companies, to Education, to Healthcare, to the Hospitality Industry and Security
                                    Protection.

                                    Due to the increasing change of job in the Tech world of Cloud Computing, jobs are moving from
                                    individual organizations, to Cloud service providers, this will make new skill sets and positioning
                                    will need to fulfilled.
                                    <br />
                                    Due to the change of the tech world, migrating to Cloud Computing, this dramatically increases the
                                    security risks. This I because, Cloud Computing is everywhere, across multiple devices,
                                    with users worldwide. This makes security incredibly hard to manage. (Collabera, 2019).</p>

                                    <p><b><i>How will this affect you?</i></b></p>

                                    <p>Cloud Computing is a huge portion of today’s society and technology,
                                      due to this everyone is affected by the changes of the Cloud.
                                      <br />
                                      Personally the increase of Cloud Computing in the tech world has affected me,
                                      because most programs these days are all monthly paid subscriptions. This affects me because
                                      my daily life is working on my computer from home, and due to all these subscriptions,
                                      I am needing to pay to do all my work gets rather expensive, especially with the little income I receive.
                                      <br />
                                      However, the Cloud does help, this is because you can save money by using Cloud Computing,
                                      this is done by saving you from having to part with more money, from having to buy more storage and
                                      ways to protect data. Cloud Computing also helps in the day to day life while using your personal computer,
                                      because, of a feature called server-side rendering, this is a feature that uses Cloud Computing to
                                      take the workload of processing a view onto one of the providers infrastructure and serving it to a
                                      you for a unique, personalized experience.</p>

                                      <p>As for my family and friends, Cloud Computing affects them all differently.</p>

                                      <p>My sister is a Secondary School Teacher, Cloud Computing affects her in a different way than most,
                                        this is because it does not affect her directly, however she is affected by Cloud Computing because
                                        her school she works for are able to get more access to the more expensive programs,
                                        which in return helps increase the resources she has access to  teach her students.
                                        <br />
                                        My Mother is an Aged Care Personal Care Assistant/ Assistant in Nursing (PCA/AIN ),
                                        Cloud Computing affects her in a different way again, just like my sister,
                                        my mum isn’t affected by the Cloud directly. Cloud Computing affects her because,
                                        they use a server room to store all the information about the residents, as well as
                                        the quantity of stock and equipment.</p>

                    <h3>Mod Manager Overlay for Twitch</h3>
                    <p>The project we have chosen is based on Jamie's idea for Assignment 1 (Walters, 2019).
                        Jamie's original proposal outlines a graphical interface that allows game streamers on the
                        Twitch platform the ability to add, remove, and find mods for the game they are playing without
                        having to switch to a third-party tool in the middle of a live stream.
                    </p>
                    <p>Twitch can be used to broadcast video streams by using their website, but they also have a
                        dedicated application for Windows, MacOS, Android, and iOS (Twitch, 2019).
                        The mechanism through which our mod-manager will interface between Twitch, local game files, and
                        hosted mods is called Twitch Extensions (Twitch Developers, 2019).
                        Extensions expand the base functionality of streams by adding interactive UI elements to a
                        variety of views from the video player itself to the streamer's profile page, leading to higher
                        audience engagement and a more personalised experience.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Technical Overview</h4>
                    <p>In creating a Twitch extension through the developer portal, the developer is required to choose
                        where their extension will appear on the Twitch UI.
                        Our extension will appear as an overlay over the streamed video in both docked and full screen
                        mode.
                        Viewers will be able to see the mods the streamer is using in the current game, but only the
                        streamer will be able to modify said mods.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img class="d-none d-lg-block img-fluid" src="images/twitchExtension.jpg"
                            alt="Twitch extension types">
                    </div>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <p>After developers choose their extension type, they are prompted to download a developer tool
                        called Twitch Developer Rig.
                        This tool allows developers to test extensions in a local environment using their
                        Electron-wrapped desktop application (Twitch Developers, 2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>The below image shows manual configuration details and environmental variables that Twitch
                        Developer Rig will automatically configure for ease of use.</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img class="d-none d-lg-block img-fluid" src="images/twitchExtension2.jpg"
                            alt="Twitch Developer Rig">
                    </div>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <p>This GUI tool basically plugs into a folder that contains the local files for the extension, and
                        when a developer clicks “Run Front End” from within the Developer Rig, the GUI will simply run
                        the corresponding script from package.json.</p>
                    <p>The below image shows a folder structure for a working test extension to give developers a head
                        start in extension development.</p>
                    <p>These files were automatically generated by Twitch Development Rig</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img class="d-none d-lg-block img-fluid" src="images/twitchExtension3.jpg"
                            alt="Twitch Developer Rig">
                    </div>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <p>The biggest advantage of using Twitch Developer Rig is being able to see how our extension looks
                        inside a simulated Twitch UI.</p>
                    <p>The below image reflects how our overlay might appear over the Twitch video and allows us to
                        visualize how our application works.</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img class="d-none d-lg-block img-fluid" src="images/twitchExtension4.jpg"
                            alt="Twitch Developer Rig">
                    </div>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <p>The architecture of this application is as follows. When the streamer configures the extension, a
                        node.js server is installed at the root of the streamer's Steam games folder
                        (Support.steampowered.com, 2019).</p>
                    <p>When the streamer interacts with the overlay over their Twitch stream, their client will send a
                        request to the Node server, which will in turn update the local files inside its running
                        directory.</p>
                    <p>The current state of the application will be sent to another public server that will be the
                        official back end of this application. Because the server is public, viewers will be able to see
                        the mods a streamer is running.</p>
                    <p>Modifying mods will not be accessible to viewers, and this view will be hidden behind a
                        configuration view that's only accessible to the streamer.</p>
                    <p>The mods themselves are all hosted on the public server, and in addition to this application
                        being a highly convenient tool for Twitch, this platform will serve as an ecosystem to publish
                        and host mods in a way where they're accessible for both streamers and their viewers, leading to
                        increased discovery for the developers who create these mods and the gamers who use them.
                    </p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Forum tab to see what people are saying about the game you are in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Creators pages, to submit bugs or to provide feedback.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I would like the UI to be clean and easy to use.
                        It would need to be slightly transparent as to still see what is going on in-game.
                        At the top you would have tabs going from left to right displaying the different categories such
                        as home, add-ons, social, forums, feedback and help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The home tab would just have an overview of all recent activity.
                        The colour theme would still be the twitch purple but a little transparent to make it look more
                        of a lavender colour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The add-ons tab would have your usual search, browse, top add-ons trending and paid if they
                        wanted to go down that route.
                        If you are using this overlay, you would most likely know what add-ons your looking for so
                        having the search button first would just be easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The social tab would have your friends online and who is offline, you will be able to click onto
                        your friend’s name and talk to them via private message.
                        You will also be able to view your friend’s profile as well.
                        The forum tab will be simple with a search button and a create button, it would also have a
                        trending and new part of the page with about the 10 of each on the page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last tab would be where you search and see creator’s pages that have all their add-ons so
                        you can provide feedback or even submit bugs/problems with the addons they are providing.
                        You will be able to activate the overlay via a keystroke of your choosing.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Feasibility</h4>
                    <p>Twitch allows developers to host their front end files and extension files for free; however, our
                        back end will need a dedicated server and a database.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, a cross-platform installer that can detect the location of a streamer's local game
                        files and copy a Node server to this location will be necessary.</p>
                    <p>The Twitch EBS (Extension Backend Service) is the biggest technical obstacle in building this
                        application. A detailed knowledge of the Twitch API is necessary to connect an application's
                        front end to a backend server that's interfacing with Twitch.</p>
                    <p>A developer working on this project will need to have substantial backend experience with Node.js
                        and deployment experience with Twitch extensions.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, this developer will need a working understanding of React.js as well as Webpack build
                        tools.</p>
                    <p>Overall, a mid-level to senior engineer, or a junior engineer with a decent amount of experience
                        using EBS, will be required.</p>
                    <p>Because this application is also a platform for discovering mods, this project could benefit from
                        a team of at least three developers.</p>

                    <p>I see this application as having three parts: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The node server connecting to the streamer's local game files</li>
                        <li>The frontend and backend of the extension reflecting a streamers mods</li>
                        <li>The platform for discovering and publishing new mods</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It would therefore make the most sense to break this project up into three parts and have a
                        dedicated developer for each part.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the entry requirements for users, any user capable of running a web browser is able to
                        use this application.</p>

                    <h4>Use Case</h4>
                    <p>
                        There is currently no mod management tool for Steam-based games that also interfaces with
                        Twitch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is nothing worse than having to exit a game completely to add a mod or add-on.
                        Most add-ons are just UI changes so if you just reload the UI in World of Warcraft for example
                        you should be able to see the new add-on you just installed.
                        Just like a smartphone, installing applications does not require to restart the phone.
                        So just a little add-on to a game should not require you to close the game completely.
                    </p>
                    <p>Not only is switching tabs mid stream inconvenient, it's also risky.</p>

                        Every time a streamer has to alt-tab out of their game while streaming live, they risk revealing
                        sensitive information to their audience and doxxing themselves (The Conversation, 2019).
                    </p>
                    I believe this extension would be a very beneficial addition to an already growing company and its
                    users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being able to add mods on the fly, talk to content creators, provide feedback, and also search
                        forums all without alt tabbing out of the game.
                        I believe if it was to be created it would have a welcoming reception to the users of Twitch and
                        Curse.
